tesseract4j ocr testing

Open the project in NetBeans. Expand the directory structure and add the JAR files found in the "lib" folder. (These are not automatically integrated so you must do it yourself). There should be 19 or so JAR files. 

Once that is done, run Main.java in the "tesseracttest" package under "Source Packages".  See line 16 in Main.java to change the image used.
